The last couple of days I've been very busy with two projects, a game in Javascript and Canvas, and a Flask application that will let you generate a fake post title for a specific Subreddit using Markov chains. Both have been so much fun. I can't wait to spend more time on game development, and have started to look at games in a different light. I like to play games, but only for a couple of hours a month (unless I fire up Civilization 5, God that game eats time up). Figuring out how games work and creating them is maybe more fun than playing them!
Also playing with text is very satisfying, and I am going to spend some time next month getting more familiar with the NLTK Python toolkit. The more I learn, the more I want to learn...

All the  projects I have been working on last couple of weeks need a bit of polishing before I want to publish them. End of this week and next week (last week at recurse already!) will be the time to finish loose ends and do some css magic to make it look good.

Talking about games, this [rock paper shotgun review](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/01/04/slave-of-god-review/) of Slave of God made sure that I know what I'll be playing tonight.
