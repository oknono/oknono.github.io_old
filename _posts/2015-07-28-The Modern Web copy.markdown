Starting today I am going to read a little bit of the book [The Modern Web](http://www.modernwebbook.com/) every day until I finish it. It is published by [No Starch Press](https://www.nostarch.com/). So far I really like their books, another I am working with is [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)(available for free online!).

Today I read the introduction and the first two chapters ("the web platform" and "structure and semantics"). This is a [link](http://www.one-tab.com/page/qT8SP1ttSlKHJOpZCeqPMQ) with resources about things that are discussed in these chapters. [OneTab](https://www.one-tab.com/) is a great way to group and store tabs. Also it will allow you to easily share a bunch of links. My experience is that sharing links doesn't work in Firefox, but does work with the Chrome extension. I like to store tabs by subject to revisit later. Another useful tab tool I use is [Tree Style Tab (firefox plugin)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/) showing open tabs vertically for a better overview.
