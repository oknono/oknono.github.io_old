title: Hey Molly, I know you're a supporter and friend of several pornstars and I
  was wondering what your views are on the industry as a whole - do you believe that
  the destructive negative side of the industry (eg. the commodification of sex, objectifying
  women, ingraining unrealistic standards of attractive in men's minds, and causing
  damage by legitimizing an industry which is often nasty and degrading to actors
  at a lower level). How do you reconcile these factors with your support. Thanks
  :)

<p>Let’s think of this question another way.</p><p>Imagine that I was friends with and a supporter of several young architects.</p><p>Construction is an industry rife with exploitation and abuse of workers on a lower level.  In some countries, like Qatar, hundreds of men die, under the worst conditions, to create buildings like the World Cup Stadia.  I personally interviewed construction workers in The Gulf who were abused, cheated, and had their travel documents taken by employers.  On a larger level, construction often leads to ecological destruction, gentrification, and destruction of architectural treasures at the whims of real estate developers.  The displacement of people that new building creates is sometimes horrifically violent. Architects often do not to have much control over the labor conditions of those who construct their designs.  Worse, many, like Zaha Hadid, who famously said “I have nothing to do with the workers,” don’t care.</p><p>Given the destructive, violent side of the construction industry, how could anyone support any architect, you might ask.</p><p>This is because supporting (let alone befriending) a worker in an industry has nothing to do with approving with labor violations in that industry.  In fact, it usually means you care more about those violations, because they’re happening to your loved one. </p><p>But stigmatizing an entire industry, and trying to make the workers in that industry lose their jobs, does nothing to help anyone.  </p><p>The best way to support workers, particularly in stigmatized industries, is to listen to them, and to support worker led initiatives to help improve conditions.  In porn, The <a href="http://apac-usa.com">Adult Performer Advocacy Committee</a> is one such organization. </p><p><br/></p><p>EDITED TO ADD: If you limited your friends only to those who worked in industries that have never harmed other people, you’d have a very small group of friends.  <br/><br/>As a mental challenge, name a totally just industry.  Academe?  NGOs?  Healthcare?  </p>
