We have to be warriors'</a><br/><p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jun/18/marina-abramovic-the-planet-is-dying-we-have-to-be-warriors?CMP=fb_gu"></a>“There are three Marinas in me. The one Marina is very heroic. I just go
 for it. I don’t care how much pain inside. Then we have second Marina –
 very different, very spiritual, very emotional. Too emotional. Can cry 
all the time. Is kind of pain in arse. And then there is third one who 
really like bullshit. Who like fashion, who like eating chocolate. Who 
like to be lazy and doing nothing and try to avoid any hardship, any 
confrontation. All these are real.”<br/></p>
