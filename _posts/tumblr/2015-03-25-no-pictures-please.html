<p>Tumblr has a problem with displaying my pictures, even if I host them elsewhere :/ So, what would you recommend as a platform? Or as a fix to this situation?In other news, I missed my flight to Bangkok and will hang out in Cambodia a bit longer. Coding can be done anywhere, and a beach sounds like the perfect place for now. First some city life in Phnom Penh. ( I still can’t write Phnom Penh without checking three times for correct spelling. Maybe it’s easier in Khmer :/)</p><p>Reading: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/books/review/book-review-cambodias-curse-by-joel-brinkley.html"><i>“Cambodia’s Curse”</i></a> by Joel Brinkley.<br/></p><p>Read: <a href="http://www.movetocambodia.com/book/"><i>Move to Cambodia: A guide to living and working in the Kingdom of Wonder</i></a> by Lina Goldberg<br/></p>
