<p>Holiday in Cambodia is great! Saw temples, rode bikes, made friends, drank my body volume in green tea milk (gained some body volume in the process), managed to not smoke a single cigarette (62 days!) and got a great haircut by a drunk tattoo artist in the back of a bar in Phnom Penh last night. Â Tomorrow I&rsquo;m going to have beers with a friend who lives in Kampot, and now I am going to have cake. Hakuna Matata bitches!</p>
