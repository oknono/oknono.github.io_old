<p>I going to try to give some more frequent updates about what I am working on at the<a href="https://www.recurse.com/"> Recurse Center</a>. This week marks the beginning of the 5th week, and boy time sure does fly. </p><p>Week 1 and 2 : The first two weeks were mostly spend on settling in and getting used to the new place, the new people and the new time zone. The older I can the less I can handle things like jet lag, it’s pathetic but true. There were workshops on cryptography ( by <a href="http://www.frankwang.org/">Frank Wang</a>), working with git, an introduction to Haskell, algorithms and some interaction design. I started this <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/crypto">cryptography course</a> on Coursera, and took my first look at JavaScript</p><p>Week 3: Continued with the cryptography course. I paired on my first project writing a <a href="https://github.com/oknono/Coin_Toss">simple coin toss</a> in JavaScript. I did a <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-basics--ud804">JavaScript tutorial </a>on audacity and started with the online course/book <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">eloquent JavaScript</a>. Besides JavaScript I spend some time working on small python exercises in vim to keep both my python skills up and to get some more exposure and exercise in using vim. Other than that I learned some new bash skills and make my first pull request in Github.</p><p>Week 4: Two workshops by <a href="http://www.decontextualize.com/">Allison Parrish</a>, one on Twitter-bots and another one on the <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict">Carnegie melon pronunciation library</a>. If I make some progress with building some projects with JavaScript, I’d like to look at some natural language processing in Python. I did some more work with Eloquent JavaScript and started a <a href="http://alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3">tutorial on D3</a>. I took a look at <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">sketch </a>for designing the interfaces for my projects. I finally got some practice and skills in reading and writing to and from files in Python.</p><p>Week 5: My plans for this week are as follows<br/>- Work on a project using JavaScript (libraries) / probably an Online I ching<br/>- Keep working on Eloquent JavaScript - try to get to the chapters with projects.<br/>- Find a nice data set for a D3 project<br/>- Continue with the algorithms course<br/>- Quit the cryptography course for now<br/>- Keep working on small exercises in Python using Vim</p>
