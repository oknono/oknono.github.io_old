<p>Day before - buy ticket (750 thb) at Mo Chit bus station</p><p><b>05:00</b> Get up and head to bus station by foot, BTS, bus and, fuck it, taxi (and arrive about an hour too early).</p><figure data-orig-height="1800" data-orig-width="1080"><img data-orig-height="1800" data-orig-width="1080" alt="image" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/ac55f6cf4eb431d6882c689fd2667a2d/tumblr_inline_nl5m4cjfke1slrzo6.jpg"/></figure><p><i>The city is booting up</i><br/></p><figure data-orig-height="1800" data-orig-width="1080"><img data-orig-height="1800" data-orig-width="1080" alt="image" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/711881efe4698c5e936a64a70fa99999/tumblr_inline_nl5m4y7hbn1slrzo6.jpg"/></figure><p><i>Obviously get some caffeine to stay awake during the trip</i><b><br/></b></p><p><b>08:00</b> Scheduled AND actual departure from Mo Chit bus station.<br/><b>08:17 </b>Food! 2 pastries ( American girl 1: It’s, like, not particularly bad, but, like, also not like particularly good), Orange juice (American girl 2 : It’s like not good, but it’s like also not bad), water and a coffee/sugar concoction.</p><figure data-orig-height="648" data-orig-width="1080"><img data-orig-height="648" data-orig-width="1080" alt="image" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/cb9d91e845e5437c13a6169958434bb5/tumblr_inline_nl5m6fG4iP1slrzo6.jpg"/></figure><p><i>Not bad, not good breakfast. Some sugar to start of the trip</i><br/></p><p><b>9:24</b> Girl 1 and 2 stop their incessant chatter and it’s gloriously quiet.<br/><b>10:08</b> The sleeping Japanese boy next to is starting to lightly lean into me.<br/><b>10:15 - 10:35</b> “ten minute” break. One girl has never seen a squat toilet before.<br/><b>11:47</b> The Japanese boy falls asleep on my shoulder. He’s not drooling, I let it slide.<br/><b>12:12</b> We get little cards to put around our necks so we can be distinguished from the other lambs.<br/><b>12:27</b> Unexplained stop - A 3rd party jumps in to sell more expensive visa. After grilling he admits that you can also get one yourself, but he’s not willing to disclose how much cheaper that would be - They should sell it as: for 10 USD extra you can drink beers and play blackjack for two hours instead of standing in stupid lines.<br/><b>12:40 </b>My new Japanese BF pays the inflated visa price. It’s a short-lived romance. Sucker.<br/><b>12:47</b> Lunch (American girl 1: the rice is like, pretty good).</p><figure data-orig-height="648" data-orig-width="1080"><img data-orig-height="648" data-orig-width="1080" alt="image" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/93550d638848c70d20b08ce95e77287d/tumblr_inline_nl5mfsIK1d1slrzo6.jpg"/></figure><p><i>With mystery protein source</i></p><p><b>12:54</b> Finally driving again.<br/><b>13:01</b> Girl 1 and 2 start talking about hummus for, like, the longest time.<br/><b>13:07</b> We arrive at the border! Again some visa sales, but easy to brush off.<br/><b>13:16 - 13:26</b> Line for Thai Customs. The customs lady cries out “Overstay!” with glee. Mai chai, extension yo!<br/><b>13:30 - 13:54  </b>Line for Cambodian passport control - fill in arrival card - get fingers prints and picture.<br/><b>14:00 </b>Back in bus, enjoying the airco.<br/><b>14:44</b> Bus leaves, after waiting for girl 1 and 2.<br/><b>17:30</b> Arrival Siem Reap. New third party arrives! Bags are loaded in office where you conveniently can book tours and bus tickets. But we’re here. Easy to leave.<br/><b>17:35 </b>Take expensive tuk tuk to hostel (100 thb).</p><p><b>Note 1</b>: Row two in the bus does not have a view (window obscured - design issue).<br/><b>Note 2</b>: There is a special place in hell for people who immediately lower their seats with complete disregard for who’s sitting behind them.<br/><b>Reading</b>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_Flying_%28novel%29">Fear of Flying</a> - which is hilarious and I want to underline every other paragraph</p><p><b>Next time!</b><br/>- visa in advance (either e-visa or obtain through embassy)<br/>- train to border (58 thb)<br/>- share taxi or grab bus or whatever on Cambodian side<br/></p>
