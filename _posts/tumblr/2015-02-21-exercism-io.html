<a href="http://exercism.io/">exercism.io</a><br/><p>Exercises in several different languages ( Clojure, CoffeeScript, C++, C#, Elixir, Erlang, F#, Go, Haskell, Java, JavaScript, Common Lisp, Lua, Objective-C, OCaml, Perl 5, PL/SQL, 
Python, Ruby, Scala, and Swift) - with feedback from other users.</p><p>My experience is that you learn so much more (and faster) when working with other people. Curious to give this a go! Starting with the Python exercises<br/></p>
