Today I spend some time getting familiar with [ipython](https://ipython.org/). This is a really cool tool for working with python. It's an interactive shell and will let you save your code. Beside codes you can also add other elements to your notebooks, like images and text. You can export your notebook to different formats. I plan to use it as an actual notebook while I am delving deeper into python.

For the text part you can use markdown, a lightweight markup (get it?) language). This blog, built with [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) also uses markdown. I decided to find a tutorial to get the most important formatting down. [This tutorial](http://markdowntutorial.com/) is quick and teaches you the most important concepts
