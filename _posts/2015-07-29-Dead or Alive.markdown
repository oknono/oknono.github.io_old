Today I deployed a Flask website that takes a person's name and returns whether that person is alive or dead using the WikiMedia API. It still needs some work (update the way it looks, and add suggestions for ambiguous names most importantly), but the logic works. You can visit it [here](http://www.deadyet.com).  

Other then that I am focusing on JavaScript again. Currently I am working my way through [You don't know Javascript](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) and [this youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgK4YaMqQFg) on how to make a game in HTML5. I'll get to back to [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) later.
