[This article](http://recompilermag.com/issues/issue-0/beginning-with-regular-expressions/) is a great introduction to regular expressions.

The blog has been quiet for the last two weeks, since I've been focusing on some other things. I had to say goodbye to the Recurse Center, all the lovely people there, and also New York. I'm back in the Netherlands and am starting a new job next week. This is all very exciting and I am working on getting my study and programming schedule up and running again.

Besides coding and working I'm hoping to add some more habits and routines to my daily life. I'd love to pick up running again, and maybe go for a swim once in a while. I also would like to establish a yoga routine that I can stick to, to counter the damage done by all the sitting. I'm keeping up with walking every day, at least ten thousand steps (that I have to estimate myself now that I accidentally put my fitbit in the washing machine). At the Recurse Center I got into the habit of meditating 30 minutes a day, and that is also something I would like to keep doing.
