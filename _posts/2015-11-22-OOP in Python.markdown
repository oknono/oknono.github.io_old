This is a great video of a talk by Raymond Hettinger about working with classes in Python: [Python's Class Development Toolkit ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTLu2DFOdTg)

Another great talk is this video about working with super in Python : [Raymond Hettinger - Super considered super! - PyCon 2015 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiOglTERPEo)
Spoiler, super works differently in Python than in other languages. Super doesn't call the parent class, but first the children of the parent class and goes to the next class in a specific order. This is an article dealing with the same subject:  [Raymond Hettinger Blog: Super considered Super](https://rhettinger.wordpress.com/2011/05/26/super-considered-super/)

I'd recommend watching all talks by Raymond Hettinger, he is a good presenter, i.e. educational and entertaining.
